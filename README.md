# ZInterpreter

This is a interpreter for the monkey programming as described in [Interpreter Book](https://interpreterbook.com/). The book has the implementation in Go, but to scratch my own itch and explore [Zig](https://ziglang.org), I decided to write it in [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

Note the I am fairly new to [Zig](https://ziglang.org), so this may not be the more idiomatic implementation.

This is purely for educational purposes and is not intended to be used in any production environment.
